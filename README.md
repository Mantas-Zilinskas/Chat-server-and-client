### To use:
1. Run makeFile.
2. Launch server.
3. Launch client (takes one command line argument for username).
### additional notes:
* One server can handle multiple clients.
* By default both server and client use ipv4 127.0.0.1 and port 8080. To change, edit the #define macros.
* These programs use Unix system calls and will not work on Windows.
